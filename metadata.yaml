description: When wealthy Rowland Mallet first sees a sculpture by Roderick Hudson,
  he is astounded and pronounces it to be a work of genius, and is equally entranced
  by the sculptor's beauty, spirit and charisma. Wishing to give the impoverished
  artist the opportunity to develop his talent, he takes Roderick from America to
  Rome, where he becomes the talk of the city. But Roderick soon loses his inspiration
  and Rowland loses control of his protégé, while both fall in love with women they
  cannot ever have.
